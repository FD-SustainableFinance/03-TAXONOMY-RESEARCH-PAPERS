## An Introduction to SF Taxonomy 
The EU Taxonomy is a tool for investors to use as they manage the shift to a low-carbon economy and determine if a particular economic activity is environmentally sustainable. It enables investors to evaluate whether investments are fulfilling strict environmental requirements and are consistent with high-level policy commitments like the Paris Agreement on Climate Change by creating a common vocabulary amongst investors, issuers, project promoters, and policy makers.This should provide security for investors, safeguard private investors from greenwashing, assist businesses in becoming more environmentally friendly, lessen market fragmentation, and assist in directing investments to areas where they are most needed. In addition to the three classic categories of climate risk, this detailed taxonomy now incorporates a fourth category called "natural capital" to represent specific climate concerns:

1. Acute and ongoing physical risks; 
2. Transition risks related to adaptation; 
3. Transition risks related to mitigation, including reputational and legal risks; and 
4. Natural capital risks, which primarily reflect the depletion of both renewable and non-renewable resources that are themselves impacted by climate risk factors.

## A Taxonomy Analysis of ISSB, EBA Pillar 3,TCFD, SASB, EFRAG and SEC
### ISSB
* The ISSB was founded by the IFRS Foundation at COP26 in Glasgow, November 2021.
* Aims to develop standards that result in a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosures focused on the needs of investors and the financial markets.
* Standards to cover important sustainability topics (environmental, social, governance—ESG), beginning with climate, both on a thematic and industry-specific basis.
* Will build on the work of existing reporting initiatives, incl:
     * Climate Disclosure Standards Board
     * Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
     * European Banking Authority Pillar 3
     * SASB Standards
     * World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics

The ISSB published two draft standards proposals in March 2022:
* [Exposure Draft IFRS S1](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/general-sustainability-related-disclosures/exposure-draft-ifrs-s1-general-requirements-for-disclosure-of-sustainability-related-financial-information.pdf): General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information
* [Exposure Draft IFRS S2](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/climate-related-disclosures/issb-exposure-draft-2022-2-climate-related-disclosures.pdf): Climate-related Disclosures

The proposed S1 General Requirements would require companies to disclose information about all of their significant sustainability-related risks and opportunities. S2 Climate-related Disclosures provides specific guidance on reporting climate-related risks and opportunities. It incorporates the recommendations of the TCFD and includes metrics tailored to industry classifications derived from the industry-based SASB Standards. 


### TCFD
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) established the [Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)](https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdf) in 2015 to develop uniform climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by businesses, banks, and investors in informing stakeholders. The financial system will be more stable, there will be a better understanding of climate risks, and it will be easier to finance the shift to a more sustainable and stable economy if there is more accurate information available on how exposed financial institutions are to climate-related risks and opportunities. 

The TCFD focuses on documenting how an organisation affects the climate on a global scale. It aims to improve consistency and comparability among companies' climate-related disclosures. Better information, in its opinion, will enable businesses to take climate-related risks and opportunities into account when making risk management, strategic planning, and decision-making decisions. The ability of markets to direct investment toward sustainable and resilient solutions, opportunities, and business models will improve as businesses and investors alike get a greater grasp of the financial consequences of climate change. It can be explained as follows: 
#### Governance:
* Explain how the board monitors climate-related threats and opportunities.
* Outline the function of management in identifying and addressing climate-related risks and opportunities.
#### Strategy:
* Describe the short-, medium-, and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified. 
* Describe the impact of these risks and opportunities on the organization's operations, strategy, and financial planning.
* Highlight the organization's strategy's resilience while considering various climate-related scenarios
#### Risks:
* Elucidate the organization's methods for recognising and evaluating climate-related threats.
* Describe the organization's procedures for mitigating hazards associated with the climate
* Explain the methods used to incorporate climate-related risk management into the organization's overall risk management.
#### Metrics and Objectives:
* Declare the metrics that the organisation uses to evaluate opportunities and hazards connected to climate change in accordance with its strategy and risk management procedure.
* Disclose the risk associated with Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if applicable, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
* Describe the objectives that the organisation uses to manage opportunities and risks connected to climate change, as well as performance against targets.


### EBA Pillar 3
[The European Banking Authority (EBA)](https://www.eba.europa.eu/) is a regulatory agency of the European Union headquartered in Paris. Its activities include conducting stress tests on European banks to increase transparency in the European financial system and identifying weaknesses in banks' capital structures. Following the recent updates to the regulatory frameworks for credit institutions and investment firms, and the publication in 2018 of the European Commission’s action plan on sustainable finance, the EBA is implementing a new policy strategy on institutions’ Pillar 3 disclosures that seeks to increase efficiency of institutions’ disclosures and reinforce market discipline by developing a comprehensive framework with consistent and comparable disclosures.

* The EBA intends to encourage institutions to improve their management of Environmental, Social, or Governance (ESG) risks while also raising awareness of their crucial role in the shift to a green economy.
* By establishing mandatory and uniform disclosure requirements, including granular templates, tables, and accompanying instructions, the EBA ESG Pillar 3 will aid in addressing the weaknesses of institutions' current ESG disclosures at the EU level. Additionally, it will support the development of worldwide best practises.
* The draft would provide equivalent quantitative disclosures on physical and transition risks associated with climate change, as well as information on exposures to assets with a carbon footprint and assets vulnerable to both chronic and acute climate change events.
* The draft contains KPIs on the assets of the institutions that finance environmental sustainability-related activities as defined by the EU taxonomy (GAR and BTAR), such as those in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement.

### SASB 

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is a nonprofit organisation that works independently. Its goal is to create and promote sustainability accounting standards that assist public companies in providing investors with important, decision-useful information. A thorough procedure that involves evidence-based research and substantial, balanced stakeholder input is used to carry out that aim.
SASB develop sustainability accounting standards most relevant to the financial performance in 77 industries to help businesses provide investors and other capital market participants with decision-useful information about a variety of sustainability-related risks and opportunities by identifying the sustainability disclosure topics that are most pertinent to enterprise value for the typical company in an industry.

SASB standards can de downloaded from their site [here](https://www.sasb.org/standards/download/?lang=en-us)

### EFRAG
[EFRAG](https://www.efrag.org/Assets/Download?assetUrl=%2Fsites%2Fwebpublishing%2FSiteAssets%2FED_ESRS_2.pdf) was formed to offer technical guidance to the European Commission on accounting-related issues. Additionally, it was tasked with contributing to the creation of IFRS sustainability standards. Its goal is to advance European perspectives on financial and sustainability reporting in the service of the public interest in Europe. The CSRD proposal, which would modify the current reporting requirements of the NFRD, was approved by the EU on April 21, 2021 as a component of the European Green Deal. The proposal designated EFRAG as the Commission's technical advisor in charge of creating the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).
The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were released as a set of exposure drafts that outline reporting requirements across 13 EGS issues. The 13 ESG issues are categorized into four areas as follows:

* Cross-cutting: General principles, general, strategy, governance, and materiality assessment.
* Environment: Climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity, resource use and circular economy.
* Social: Own workforce, workers in the value chain, affected communities, consumers, and end-users.
* Governance: Governance, risk management, internal control, and business conduct.
Compared to ISSB, EFRAG has a much more stakeholder lens. S, a variety of users want to see the devopment of a company's sustainability not just investors. 


### SEC
A domestic or international registrant would have to provide certain climate-related information in its registration statements and periodic reports under rule modifications the [Securities and Exchange Commission](file:///C:/Users/jkennedy/Downloads/SEC%20Proposed%20Disclosure%20Requirements%20(1).pdf) proposed. The proposed disclosures are comparable to those that many businesses now provide based on widely used disclosure frameworks, such the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and would include:
* How any identified climate-related risks have affected or are likely to affect the registrant's strategy, business model, and outlook
* How any identified climate-related risks have affected or are likely to affect the registrant's processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks 
* How any identified climate-related risks have manifested over the short-, medium-, or long-term.
* Indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in a registrant’s value chain (Scope 3), if material, or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions target or goal that includes Scope 3 emissions, in absolute terms, not including offsets, and in terms of intensity
* A registrant may also provide information about any identified climate-related opportunities in response to any of the governance, strategy, and risk management elements of the proposed rules.

## An Introduction to Insurance Regulation and Reporting
Key Regulations (UK/EU)
#### 1) Solvency II – EU Directive
Pillar 1 – valuation of assets/liabilities and capital requirements
* Sets out how insurers should value:
    * liabilities inc. payouts to policyholders in event of a claim
    * assets (such as government bonds, shares, property, etc)
    * amount of funds to be held in reserve as a buffer for paying policyholders' claims

Pillar 2 – governance and risk management 
* Sets out how insurers:
    * should be governed
    * identify, measure, monitor, manage and report the risks to which they are exposed
    * ensure that their businesses are managed to a high standard
* Includes the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)
    * EIOPA has published guidelines for integrating climate change risk materiality assessment and scenario analyses within the ORSA (see Useful Links below)

Pillar 3 – reporting and disclosure 
* Sets out what information insurers report on their business
*  Certain reporting required to be public, some privately reported to the national regulator
*Under S2 P3, Firms must produce two key reports:
    * Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR): disclosed publicly and to the local National Competent Authority. Includes both qualitative and quantitative info     * Regular Supervisory Report (RSR): private report to the supervisor. Submitted to the local NCA in full at least every three years and in summary every year.   Includes both qualitative and quantitative information
    * Additionally, Quantitative Reporting Templates (QRTs) and National Specific Templates (NSTs)
    
 
#### 2) International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) (under FSB)
* Common Framework (ComFrame) for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups
* Insurance Capital Standards (ICS) for the supervision of large insurance groups that operate in a number of jurisdictions
* Insurance Core Principles (ICPs), relating to the supervision of insurers generally
* Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SII) assessment methodology and policy framework, which forms part of the FSB’s broader framework for global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs)

#### 3) International (or UK) Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS/UKFRS)

#### 4) Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) – EU Directive
* Regulates how insurance products are designed and distributed in the EU
* Ensures distributors take responsibility for consumer outcomes and that products meet consumer needs·Imposes conduct of business and transparency rules on distributors
* Clarifies procedures and rules for cross-border business
* Covers supervision and sanctioning of insurance distributors that don’t comply with the IDD
* Insurance product information document (IPID)

#### 5) Packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) – EU Regulation·
* Improve transparency and comparability of investment products across the EU through key information documents (KIDs)
* More of an investment regulation but affects investment products with built-in insurance (or vice versa)

## Green Asset Ratio
Green Asset Ratio (GAR) key performance indicator (KPI) under the Taxonomy Regulation shows the proportion of exposures related to Taxonomy-aligned activities compared to the total assets of those credit institutions. To represent the amount to which these institutions finance Taxonomy-aligned activities, the GAR should be related to the primary lending and investing operations of the credit institutions, including loans, advances, and debt instruments as well as their equity holdings. The GAR classifies both qualified and aligned green assets according to the EU's taxonomy for sustainable operations, measuring "green assets" as a percentage of a bank's overall assets.From the outset, one would assume that the calculation of GAR would be simple. However, difficulties include categorising exposures to calculate it, misreporting it and the way banks identify a way to utilise it as the world adjusts to the new age of climate sustainability. More precisely:
* Banks will need to carefully examine how they construct their GAR disclosures due to data limitations and restrictions on the scope of the GAR calculation. For example, how they provide a picture to investor of how green they can be
* GAR has huge potentially to maximise balance sheets. This metric, however, can make it difficult to exactly determine the value of a balance sheet, especially if it effects the cost of funding and credit ratings.
* The GAR adds to a long line of measures requiring banks to collect information on customers and counterparties that are affected by the climate.Banks should avoid handling these obligations in silos and instead place the data needs for the GAR in the larger strategic context of other sustainability-related regulations, such as TCFD disclosures.
* In order to complete this study, banks must consider their product strategy. The future trajectory of the market for green goods is still unknown. However, it is likely that green products will become increasingly popular in order to make real progress toward the climate transition, to reach objectives like net zero, and to satisfy growing customer demand. To be following the EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring, EU banks must apply ESG considerations to every step of the loan origination process, including pricing. Banks now have an extra incentive to boost their loans to Taxonomy-aligned operations as a result of the GAR's adoption.
