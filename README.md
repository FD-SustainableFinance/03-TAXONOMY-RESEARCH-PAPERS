# [3] TAXONOMY RESEARCH

This needs a table format with:
- name of research paper
- contributing partners
- links to individual reserach page - we will not reproduce the fiull research paper , that's too big
   - on the link page set it up as a classic reserach summary page with Abstract plus other key information
   - authors
   - related research
   - etc
   
 Tidy up, move and remove all other content below to match the above format.

## An Introduction to SF Taxonomy 
The EU Taxonomy is a tool for investors to use as they manage the shift to a low-carbon economy and determine if a particular economic activity is environmentallyÂ sustainable. It enables investors to evaluate whether investments are fulfilling strict environmental requirements and are consistent with high-level policy commitments like the Paris Agreement on Climate Change by creating a common vocabulary amongst investors, issuers, project promoters, and policy makers.This should provide security for investors, safeguard private investors from greenwashing, assist businesses in becoming more environmentally friendly, lessen market fragmentation, and assist in directing investments to areas where they are most needed. In addition to the three classic categories of climate risk, this detailed taxonomy now incorporates a fourth category called "natural capital" to represent specific climate concerns:

1. Acute and ongoing physical risks; 
2. Transition risks related to adaptation; 
3. Transition risks related to mitigation, including reputational and legal risks; and 
4. Natural capital risks, which primarily reflect the depletion of both renewable and non-renewable resources that are themselves impacted by climate risk factors.
