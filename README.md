## An Introduction to SF Taxonomy 
The EU Taxonomy is a tool for investors to use as they manage the shift to a low-carbon economy and determine if a particular economic activity is environmentally sustainable. It enables investors to evaluate whether investments are fulfilling strict environmental requirements and are consistent with high-level policy commitments like the Paris Agreement on Climate Change by creating a common vocabulary amongst investors, issuers, project promoters, and policy makers.This should provide security for investors, safeguard private investors from greenwashing, assist businesses in becoming more environmentally friendly, lessen market fragmentation, and assist in directing investments to areas where they are most needed. In addition to the three classic categories of climate risk, this detailed taxonomy now incorporates a fourth category called "natural capital" to represent specific climate concerns:

1. Acute and ongoing physical risks; 
2. Transition risks related to adaptation; 
3. Transition risks related to mitigation, including reputational and legal risks; and 
4. Natural capital risks, which primarily reflect the depletion of both renewable and non-renewable resources that are themselves impacted by climate risk factors.

## A Taxonomy Analysis of ISSB EBA Pillar 3, SASB, EFRAG and SEC
### ISSB
* The ISSB was founded by the IFRS Foundation at COP26 in Glasgow, November 2021.
* Aims to develop standards that result in a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosures focused on the needs of investors and the financial markets.
* Standards to cover important sustainability topics (environmental, social, governance—ESG), beginning with climate, both on a thematic and industry-specific basis.
* Will build on the work of existing reporting initiatives, incl:
     * Climate Disclosure Standards Board
     * Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
     * European Banking Authority Pillar 3
     * SASB Standards
     * World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics
The ISSB published two draft standards proposals in March 2022:
* [Exposure Draft IFRS S1](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/general-sustainability-related-disclosures/exposure-draft-ifrs-s1-general-requirements-for-disclosure-of-sustainability-related-financial-information.pdf): General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information
* [Exposure Draft IFRS S2](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/climate-related-disclosures/issb-exposure-draft-2022-2-climate-related-disclosures.pdf): Climate-related Disclosures

The proposed S1 General Requirements would require companies to disclose information about all of their significant sustainability-related risks and opportunities. S2 Climate-related Disclosures provides specific guidance on reporting climate-related risks and opportunities. It incorporates the recommendations of the TCFD and includes metrics tailored to industry classifications derived from the industry-based SASB Standards.

## An Introduction to SF Taxonomy Mapping
This is of particular interest to the evolving sustainable finance solutions being developed between [First Derivative](https://firstderivative.com/sustainable-finance/), [Corlytics](https://www.corlytics.com/), [Solidatus](https://www.solidatus.com/) and [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) with funding from [Skillnet Ireland](https://www.skillnetireland.ie/).
We see a future where end-to-end, multi-nodal taxonomy mapping becomes central to all operating models for data, risk, controls and reporting.
