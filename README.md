# [3] TAXONOMY RESEARCH PAPERS
As part of the evolution of OS-SFT, contributing partners wish to push the frontiers of sustainable finance and explore how new taxonomies may evolve to solve new problems. In this section, partners will publish papers that seek to explore and develop new ideas that may stimulate the development of the sustainability market.

## Posing Challenging Questions
We encourage partners and users to pose challenging taxonomy questions that can help to solve real business problems.

You may send questions via [Johnny Mattimore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnny-d-mattimore-082969136/) or via any other partner contacts listed on [PARTNERS](https://github.com/FD-SustainableFinance/06-PARTNERS )

Examples of questions which have been discussed for potential research papers include the following:

1. **Bonds**: How might one approach the repricing the global bond market using carbon issuer emissions data?
2. **Loans**: How might one managing discounts and premiums on green versus brown loan portfolios?
3. **Securities** What taxonomies are needed for new carbon-based securities - spot, derivatives, Exchange traded, OTC-cleared, etc?
4. **Documentation**: What happens to documentation due to new taxonomies: securities prospectus, loan agreements, ISDAs, etc? 
5. **Nature Risk**: How will nature & biodiverisity risk taxonomies evolve?
6. **Societal Risk**: Will we have a TSFD (Societal) to complement TCFD (Climate) and TNFD (Nature)?
7. **Supply Chain**: How does supply chain data fit into future credit risk modelling?
8. **Climate Risk Controls**: How can one use climate risk model taxonomies as control frameworks a in lines of businesses?
9. **Climate Risk 2-5 years**: How can one use climate risk model taxonomies for price and credit risk in the next 3-5 year window?
10. **Climate Risk Simplification**:Can I find simpler, smaller climate risk model taxonomies and will they be effective?
