## An Introduction to SF Taxonomy 
The EU Taxonomy is a tool for investors to use as they manage the shift to a low-carbon economy and determine if a particular economic activity is environmentally sustainable. It enables investors to evaluate whether investments are fulfilling strict environmental requirements and are consistent with high-level policy commitments like the Paris Agreement on Climate Change by creating a common vocabulary amongst investors, issuers, project promoters, and policy makers.This should provide security for investors, safeguard private investors from greenwashing, assist businesses in becoming more environmentally friendly, lessen market fragmentation, and assist in directing investments to areas where they are most needed. In addition to the three classic categories of climate risk, this detailed taxonomy now incorporates a fourth category called "natural capital" to represent specific climate concerns:

1. Acute and ongoing physical risks; 
2. Transition risks related to adaptation; 
3. Transition risks related to mitigation, including reputational and legal risks; and 
4. Natural capital risks, which primarily reflect the depletion of both renewable and non-renewable resources that are themselves impacted by climate risk factors.

## A Taxonomy Analysis of ISSB EBA Pillar 3, SASB, EFRAG and SEC
### ISSB
* The ISSB was founded by the IFRS Foundation at COP26 in Glasgow, November 2021.
* Aims to develop standards that result in a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosures focused on the needs of investors and the financial markets.
* Standards to cover important sustainability topics (environmental, social, governance—ESG), beginning with climate, both on a thematic and industry-specific basis.
* Will build on the work of existing reporting initiatives, incl:
     * Climate Disclosure Standards Board
     * Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
     * European Banking Authority Pillar 3
     * SASB Standards
     * World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics

The ISSB published two draft standards proposals in March 2022:
* [Exposure Draft IFRS S1](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/general-sustainability-related-disclosures/exposure-draft-ifrs-s1-general-requirements-for-disclosure-of-sustainability-related-financial-information.pdf): General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information
* [Exposure Draft IFRS S2](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/climate-related-disclosures/issb-exposure-draft-2022-2-climate-related-disclosures.pdf): Climate-related Disclosures

The proposed S1 General Requirements would require companies to disclose information about all of their significant sustainability-related risks and opportunities. S2 Climate-related Disclosures provides specific guidance on reporting climate-related risks and opportunities. It incorporates the recommendations of the TCFD and includes metrics tailored to industry classifications derived from the industry-based SASB Standards.
### EBA Pillar 3
[The European Banking Authority (EBA)](https://www.eba.europa.eu/) is a regulatory agency of the European Union headquartered in Paris. Its activities include conducting stress tests on European banks to increase transparency in the European financial system and identifying weaknesses in banks' capital structures. Following the recent updates to the regulatory frameworks for credit institutions and investment firms, and the publication in 2018 of the European Commission’s action plan on sustainable finance, the EBA is implementing a new policy strategy on institutions’ Pillar 3 disclosures that seeks to increase efficiency of institutions’ disclosures and reinforce market discipline by developing a comprehensive framework with consistent and comparable disclosures.

* The EBA intends to encourage institutions to improve their management of Environmental, Social, or Governance (ESG) risks while also raising awareness of their crucial role in the shift to a green economy.
* By establishing mandatory and uniform disclosure requirements, including granular templates, tables, and accompanying instructions, the EBA ESG Pillar 3 will aid in addressing the weaknesses of institutions' current ESG disclosures at the EU level. Additionally, it will support the development of worldwide best practises.
* The draft would provide equivalent quantitative disclosures on physical and transition risks associated with climate change, as well as information on exposures to assets with a carbon footprint and assets vulnerable to both chronic and acute climate change events.
* The draft contains KPIs on the assets of the institutions that finance environmental sustainability-related activities as defined by the EU taxonomy (GAR and BTAR), such as those in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement.

### SASB 

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is a nonprofit organisation that works independently. Its goal is to create and promote sustainability accounting standards that assist public companies in providing investors with important, decision-useful information. A thorough procedure that involves evidence-based research and substantial, balanced stakeholder input is used to carry out that aim.
SASB develop sustainability accounting standards most relevant to the financial performance in 77 industries to help businesses provide investors and other capital market participants with decision-useful information about a variety of sustainability-related risks and opportunities by identifying the sustainability disclosure topics that are most pertinent to enterprise value for the typical company in an industry.

## An Introduction to SF Taxonomy Mapping
This is of particular interest to the evolving sustainable finance solutions being developed between [First Derivative](https://firstderivative.com/sustainable-finance/), [Corlytics](https://www.corlytics.com/), [Solidatus](https://www.solidatus.com/) and [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) with funding from [Skillnet Ireland](https://www.skillnetireland.ie/).
We see a future where end-to-end, multi-nodal taxonomy mapping becomes central to all operating models for data, risk, controls and reporting.
